BAMAZON!
the future of inventory is here!

Bamazon uses

Node.js & MySQL

to allow a seller, supervisor or manager to easily keep track of their inventory by cataloging it in Bamazon!  Potential customers may then use the bamazonCustomer.js to go through a seller's inventory and claim items they want to purchase.  

to see how these programs work do the follow;
under the repo click on the green button that says code with an download down arrow,
 copy the https code with the clipboard button to the right of the code
then you will clone the repo on your computer, open a git terminal,
type:
git clone https://github.com/GitJoeCode/bamazon.git
(the link above should be the link you copied)
in a git terminal navigate to the directory you copied the repo to and change the directory to bamazon
there type:
npm install
(this will install the necessary programs needed to run bamazon in node)
if you don't have node install node globally using this command:
npm install node -g
then type:
node bamazonCustomer
or node followed by any one of the js files to run that file in node.
